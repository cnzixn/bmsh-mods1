
Charlie has Shadow and normal forms.
Charlie will turn into shadow, if her sanity falls below 45%, she will become back again, if it rises above 55%.

In Shadow Form:
1) Charlie gains nightvision!
2) Charlie gets bonus damage mult depending on day time: 1.4x day, 1.6x dusk and 1.8x during night.
3) Charlie gets bonus armor (like Wigfrid), she will take 10% less damage during dusk and 20% less at night.
4) Charlie will suffer from any lights! She will start to burn, if she stays at light! Torch, lantern, campfire, neon-party - anything bright will hurt her!
5) Items that protect from rain - protect from lights too. Use umbrella, hat, find shelters to escape light!
6) Charlie will only wear her shadow-form skin in this state.

In girl Form:
1) Charlie is not afraid of darkness at all.
2) Charlie will have +1 lvl to magic recipes.

4) Charlie will be able to change her outfit.





well they've made her so her damage depends on day time, I think we can combine that with our shadow form:
Shadow form gives 1.4x damage mult during day, 1.6x during dusk and 1.8x during night
We can also make Charlie take less damage (like wigfrid), like 0 reduction during day / 10% dusk / 20% night.
While In girl form Charlie will have damage mult like 0.8x day, 1.0x dusk, 1.2x night
